# Enable Power/Voltage/Current measurement for Shelly 2.5

# Needed Substitutions:
# device_name -> Name of the Device
# channel_1 -> Name of channel 1 for power and current name in HASS
# channel_2 -> Name of channel 2 for power and current name in HASS
# max_power -> Maximum power in watts to switch off the outputs (see neccessary scripts)
#
# Neccessary Scripts
# The Script 'all_off' is neccessary to switch off all Outputs at over_current
